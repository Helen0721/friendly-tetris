Friendly Tetris intends to be a fun kill-time game for busy people like you and me. I also view it as an opportunity to learn front-end tools like React. 

# Features

This version of Tetris supports different levels for people with or without prior exposure to Tetris. To be fair, I am still struggling to last long in the hard-level. 

To start or pause a game, press the spacebar or click the pause button.

To move a piece, use the arrow keys. You can press 'enter' or 'return' to place a piece to the bottom. 

To reset a game, press 'n' or click the new game button. 

To change the dimension of the board, use the input box at the top.

To change current level, use the drop-down box next to the label "Level".

Have FUN!
